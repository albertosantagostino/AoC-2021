## How to run

`Python 3.8` and `poetry` required. From the root folder:

````bash
# Prepare the virtualenv (will be placed at .venv/), only needed the first time
poetry install
# Activate the virtualenv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Run the script for day 01
python3.8 src/day01.py
````

The script `src/day00_template.py` can be used as a template, simply copy and rename it `day[DD].py`

Scripts are configured to automatically download puzzle inputs. To setup this, continue to the section below

### Setup (automatic input download)

To get and set your credentials: login into [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/) and open the Web Developer Tools (`CTRL+SHIFT+I`) in your browser. Go to the Storage tab (or Application/Storage in Chrome) and copy the value of your `session` cookie. Paste it into the `aoc_cookie` entry in the configuration file (`config.json`)

Notice that in the same file you can also set the year
